# Weather Analysis Application

Weather Prediction Model is a trained machine learning model for wether prediction. 
It shows usage of such libraries as: **pandas**, **seaborn**, **matplotlib** and **pytorch** for training and evaluating model.

Can be connected with my previous project [**Weather Application**](https://github.com/TykhinBiriukov/Weather-Application) which collected data about forecasts in different cities and saved them into database.
